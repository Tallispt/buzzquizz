# BuzzQuizz

The project is an online front-end page for Buzzfeed-style quizzes, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The page allows users to access all available quizzes on the homepage in order of creation, with links to an associated back-end API. Additionally, users can create their own personalized quizzes, which are stored separately from the public quizzes and are only accessible by the creator. The quizzes are designed to be engaging and interactive, with a range of question types and multimedia options to create a unique and personalized experience for each user. The design is user-friendly and visually appealing, with intuitive navigation and clear instructions to ensure a seamless user experience. Overall, this project offers an exciting and fun way for users to engage with quizzes and create their own unique content.
